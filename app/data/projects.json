		"description": "This was a four-day project in which we were required to design a screen-based interative system for clothes shopping targetted at bankers. One of our ideas was an in-store large-screen style advisor which provides advises and information of clothing matching for busy young professionals. Bankers working in nearby banks were interviewed. Two rounds of usability testing using different paper prototypes were carried out with the target users, and a more high-fi interactive prototype was built using powerpoint based on the testing results. The powerpoint prototype was then tested iteratively with potential users and modification was made accordingly, suggestions were also made for future changes.",

		"description": "This project evaluated the usability of the Yammer website based on users' satisfaction, efficiency and effectiveness. The variables investigated during the study were error rate, task completion and task completion time. The evaluation was a validation test performed upon two user groups: the novice and the expert users, who were asked to complete five tasks. The T-model observation method was used during the test, complemented by a pre-test background questionnaire and a post-test semi-structured interview. The test took place in a controlled usability lab with the help of the Morae tracking system. The results showed that the participants faced difficulties in completing more advanced tasks in the system. Based on our findings, we came up with recommendations of relabelling, increasing visibility, avoiding creeping featurism and reorganising the information structure.",

		"description": "Eye-tracking calibration usually requires users to focus on several points on screen and let eye-tracker to adapt the variance across different eyes. This process is not too long but is not so engaging, and even challenging for special users like young children or cognitively disabled. This project intended to explore and apply playful elements to the calibration process to make it more engaging, and eventually improve calibration quality in general. The whole design process was covered from understanding, to ideation, prototyping and a final evaluation performed on 24 young children. Beginning with discussing an anatomy of calibration in theory, the thesis concluded with practical discussions regarding the feasibility and directions of applying playful elements to calibration.",
